					Travel means freedom, it means finding yourself lost in the most amazing ways. ... Travel to me means making friends with the locals and respecting their culture. It means spending time in dive bars and local restaurants because someone in passing recommended it to you.

					Why bother staying in a vacation home where you have to cook your own meals and leave the premises to find entertainment? What if your vacation home plans fall through? Can you walk into another one for instant booking?Staying at a hotel can take away some of these uncertainties and instead allow you to be pampered while on vacation.

					Gone are the days when travelers need to visit their local travel agent and settle on a single fare when booking flights. Today, the Internet is a far easier option for customers to purchase airline tickets. The advantages range from quick and easy ways to compare prices on several airlines to allowing travelers to print boarding passes at home.
